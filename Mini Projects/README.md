This repo includes a collection of small UX/UI projects I designed in Figma to practice and build my skills. Each one explores different types of interfaces, from landing pages to app wireframes.

Projects Included:

Law Firm Landing Page
A clean and professional homepage design for a fictional law firm. Focused on structure, hierarchy, and trust-building visuals.

Football Academy Landing Page
An exciting landing page for a youth football academy. Designed to highlight programs, success stories, and sign-up info.

Event Ticketing App (Wireframe Practice)
A low-fidelity wireframe exploring the user journey of browsing and booking event tickets.

5 Landing Pages in 5 Days
A personal design sprint challenge to create five different landing pages over five days, focusing on speed, creativity, and layout variation.

Sneaker Shoe App (Page Design)
A stylish screen design for a sneaker appâ€”focused on browsing products and clean presentation.

Card UI Designs
Two sets of card layouts for showcasing content (e.g. products, profiles, or articles), designed to be simple, reusable, and visually appealing.

All designs were made in Figma, and each one helped me improve areas like layout, visual hierarchy, consistency, and user flow.
